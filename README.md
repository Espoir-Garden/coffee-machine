 Simple Coffee Machine Program

 Overview
This project is a Python-based Coffee Machine simulation that allows users to:
Order drinks (Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino).
Process payments and get change.
Manage and check available resources.
It showcases skills in Python fundamentals, control flow, and basic algorithms, and includes practical error handling for user inputs.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Basic familiarity with running Python scripts in a terminal or command prompt.

Features
Handles user input and checks for valid drink names.
Processes coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies) and calculates change.
Checks resource availability for drink preparation.
Provides feedback on success or failure of transactions.
Suggests the closest valid drink name for misspelled orders using the difflib library.

Example Output:
What would you like? (Espresso/Latte/Cappuccino): latte
you have chosen Latte
Please insert coins
How many quarters?: 10
How many dimes?: 1
How many nickles?: 2
How many pennies?: 5
Here is your change of $0.35
Here is your Latte

Skills Demonstrated
Working with dictionaries for data storage and lookups.
Writing reusable functions for resource checks, coin processing, and drink preparation.
Implementing input validation and error handling for user interaction.
